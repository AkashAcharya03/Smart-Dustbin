Smart Dustbin with ESP32 and Ultrasonic Sensor

Overview:
The Smart Dustbin project uses ESP32 microcontroller and ultrasonic sensor to create an intelligent waste management system. This project aims to enhance traditional waste bins by providing real-time data on the fill level of the bin, promoting efficient waste collection, and contributing to a cleaner environment.

Key Components:

ESP32 Microcontroller: The ESP32 serves as the brain of the system, facilitating communication with the ultrasonic sensor, connecting to the Wi-Fi network, and hosting a simple web server for monitoring.

Ultrasonic Sensor: The ultrasonic sensor accurately measures the distance between the sensor and the nearest object, in this case, the level of waste in the dustbin.

Wi-Fi Connectivity: The ESP32 connects to a BLYNK, allowing it to transmit data and be remotely monitored. This feature enables users to check the dustbin's status from anywhere with an internet connection.

Functionality:

Distance Measurement: The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to the surface of the waste in the dustbin. This information is crucial for determining the fill level.

Web Server: The ESP32 hosts a simple web server accessible over the Wi-Fi network. Users can connect to the server and view the real-time status of the dustbin through a BLYNK.

Status Monitoring: The web interface displays the current distance, which corresponds to the fill level of the dustbin. This information helps users decide when the bin needs to be emptied, optimizing waste collection routes.

How it Works:

The ultrasonic sensor sends out ultrasonic waves and measures the time taken for the waves to bounce back.
The ESP32 processes this time data to calculate the distance to the nearest object, i.e., the waste in the dustbin.
The ESP32 updates the web server with the current distance information, allowing users to remotely monitor the dustbin's fill level.
Benefits:

Efficient Waste Management: Users can optimize waste collection schedules based on the real-time fill level data, reducing unnecessary collections and minimizing operational costs.

Remote Monitoring: The Wi-Fi connectivity enables users to monitor the dustbin's status remotely, promoting convenience and timely decision-making.

Environmental Impact: By efficiently managing waste collection, the Smart Dustbin contributes to reducing fuel consumption and minimizing the carbon footprint associated with unnecessary collection trips.

Conclusion:
The Smart Dustbin project showcases the integration of IoT technologies to address practical challenges in waste management. With real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making, this system demonstrates a step forward in creating smarter and more sustainable urban environments.
